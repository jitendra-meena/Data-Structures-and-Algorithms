data structures and algorithms using Python



# Data Stuctures:


A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways

# Selection Sort Complexity
 ```bash
Time Complexity	 
Best	O(n2)
Worst	O(n2)
Average	O(n2)
Space Complexity	O(1)
Stability	No
Cycle	Number of Comparison
1st	(n-1)
2nd	(n-2)
3rd	(n-3)
last	1
Number of comparisons: (n - 1) + (n - 2) + (n - 3) + ..... + 1 = n(n - 1) / 2 nearly equals to n2.
```
# Complexity = O(n2)

Also, we can analyze the complexity by simply observing the number of loops. There are 2 loops so the complexity is n*n = n2.

# Time Complexities:
 ```bash

Worst Case Complexity: O(n2)
If we want to sort in ascending order and the array is in descending order then, the worst case occurs.
Best Case Complexity: O(n2)
It occurs when the array is already sorted
Average Case Complexity: O(n2)
It occurs when the elements of the array are in jumbled order (neither ascending nor descending).
```
